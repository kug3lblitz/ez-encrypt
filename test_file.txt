Hello, this is a test file for the Ez-Encrypt application!

This file contains some sample text that we can use to test the encryption and decryption functionality.

Here are some features of the application:
- Simple 3-button interface (Encrypt, Decrypt, Exit)
- AES-256 encryption with secure key derivation
- Password-based encryption
- Automatic file handling (adds .enc extension for encrypted files)
- Cross-platform GUI using eframe/egui

The application is designed to be "idiot-friendly" - just place the executable in the same directory as your files, enter a password, and click Encrypt or Decrypt!

Security features:
- Uses SHA-256 for key derivation from passwords
- Random salt generation for each encryption
- Random IV (initialization vector) for each encryption
- Salt and IV are stored with the encrypted file for proper decryption

Test data:
- Numbers: 1234567890
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]|;':".,<>?
- Unicode: 🔐 🔒 🔓 ✅ ❌ 💡

This should be sufficient content to test that the encryption/decryption process works correctly and preserves all types of characters.
